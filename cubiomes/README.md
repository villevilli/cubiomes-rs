# Cubiomes
A (hopefully) safe rust wrapper for the cubiomes library developped by cubitect

The original cubiomes library is available here: https://github.com/cubitect/cubiomes/

## Installation
use cargo to install cubiomes
``cargo add cubiomes``


The currently the library only supports biome generation, but support for at least structure
generation is planned. Feel free to submit issues or pull requests for the project.

## Cargo features
``cc_build``, use the cc create for building cubiomes, enabled by default. If not enabled
cubiomes is built with make

//! A safe wrapper for the cubiomes library, which mimics
//! minecraft worldgen for seed finding and other purposes.
//!
//! This crate provides safe bindings for [cubiomes](https://github.com/Cubitect/cubiomes) by cubitect.
//! Cubiomes is intended for use in seed finding and biome map generation with low memory overhead.
//!
//! The crate is organized into different modules which loosely correspond to features
//! available in cubiomes. The crate is still incomplete, as it doesn't provide all features
//! available in cubiomes.
//!
//! # Usage
//! See each module for usage of a specific feature of the library.
//!
//! For biome generation see [`crate::generator`]
//! For structure geneartion see [`crate::structures`]
//!
